Battleship Game Simulator
This repository contains a Python-based Battleship game simulator. The simulator is designed to play a game of Battleship between two AI players, with each player using a different strategy to play the game.

Repository Structure
Here's a brief overview of the key files in this repository:

Player.py: This file defines a Player class that represents a player in the game. Each player has their own board and a screen to track shots at the opponent. The player class also includes methods for choosing where to shoot next and for handling the situation when a boat is hit.

game.py: This file defines a Game class that represents a game of Battleship. It includes methods for updating the game state after each shot, checking if a boat is sunk, and sinking a boat.

field.py: This file defines a Field class that represents a game board. It uses the NewBoatField class from boat_field.py to add boats to the field.

boat_field.py: This file defines a NewBoatField class that is used to create a field with boats.

get_random_int.py: This file contains a function for generating random integers, which is used in various places throughout the code.

main.py: This is the main entry point for the simulator. It sets up the game and the players, and then runs the game.

main.js: This is a JavaScript version of the game. It includes a function for adding a boat to a field.

How to Run the Simulator
To run the simulator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can then run the simulator using the following command:
